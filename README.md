- **User Interaction**: Users can like, comment, and share videos.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for videos based on keywords.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be mobile-friendly.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Declarative routing for React applications.
- **Redux**: A predictable state container for JavaScript apps.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Material-UI**: A popular React UI framework for designing responsive web applications.

### Backend

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for building scalable server-side applications.
- **Express**: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd youtube-clone
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Set up MongoDB:

    - Ensure MongoDB is running on your local machine.
    - Update the MongoDB connection URI in `server/config/db.js` if necessary.

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can access the application in your web browser. The default URL is `http://localhost:3000`.
